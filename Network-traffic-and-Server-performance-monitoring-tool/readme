DESCRIPTION
-----------

The main objective of the tool is to collect and compare data from web servers and the network elements that provide them with internet access, in order to detect performance problems. The tool interfaces with the web GUI of Apache mod_status to collect web server performance metrics. CPU Load, requests/sec, bytes/request, bytes/s and Total data transferred (since the server uptime) are the metrics collected. The network devices are probed for in and out traffic through all the selected interfaces using SNMP. Both web servers and network devices are probed every 60 seconds.

The tool has a simple and responsive web GUI with following facilities:
  
  - Add or remove web servers and network devices to be monitored. In case of network devices, interfaces to be probed can also be selected.

  - To select web servers and network devices to be plotted. For web servers metrics to be plotted can also be selected. In case of network devices, interfaces to be plotted can also be selected.

  - Displays two graphs. Selected metrics for the selected web servers in one graph and in and out traffic (bytes/sec) through the selected interfaces of the selected network devices in the other graph.

  - For each network device, aggregate traffic rate (differentiated between in and out) is also displayed. The aggregate in or out traffic through a device is the aggregate of all interfaces selected to be plotted.

  - Graphs generated by the tool are RRD graphs.
